      <h1 id="about">About</h1>
<p>Hi, I am Robert and I am doing my bachelor‚Äôs in Information Technology. I am interested in <strong>Autonomous MAVs</strong>, Swarm Intelligence, <strong>IoT</strong>, Peer-to-Peer Networks, Deep Learning, Distributed Learning, and Web Application Development tools. Currently, I am working on <strong>Herd AI</strong>, A swarm of autonomous MAVs that can do things together and can be tracked over the internet. I am very much interested in solving problems in my research areas.</p>

<p><img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/herd.jpg" />
The project aims at building autonomous swarms of Micro UAVs for defense purposes.  Theseswarms can be tracked over the internet and can be controlled minimally over the internet.  Thisproject is an ongoing funded project.  More about this project can be <a href="https://johnmaxrin.github.io/herdAI/">found here.</a></p>

<p><img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/mimotico.jpeg" />
 An online platform where users can generate digital identities that can be used to prove or verify their identity anywhere. This project was a result of the research done on the vulnerabilities of the UIDAI Adhaar card. This project was funded by the state government and ASCII. <a href="https://github.com/johnmaxrin/mimotico">Github Link</a></p>

<h3 id="work-app">Work App</h3>

<p><img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/work.jpg" />
Work is an online platform to find gig work and to find a worker. You can partner with us at the same time can find people to get things done. For Example, you are having an important meeting and won‚Äôt be able to clean your house. Simply hire someone from your locality listed on our platform to clean the house. You can also list yourself as a worker with the same app. It‚Äôs flexible, be your boss. You can choose when to work and when not to. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seventythree.work">Google Playstore Link (India)</a></p>

<p><img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/intervan.jpg" />
The  main  aim  behind  this  project  was  to  learn  how  a  programming  language  works  and,During my free time, I used to build Intervan.  It gave me a great insight into the working ofa compiled programming language. <a href="https://github.com/johnmaxrin/Intervan">Github Link</a></p>

Worked in the Geo-tagging section and used various frameworks and plugins to enable the location content delivery feature.  After that,  I was assigned with the work of using AWSBucket to store user-generated Images and to tag them automatically.  This internship was very helpful in getting to know more about industrial standards. <br /> <br /></p>

Built  an  application  that  helped  people  to  find  local  skilled/unskilled  workers,  Within  a radius  of  5  Kms.   This  application  was  slowly  gaining  traction  and  eventually  became  a hectic task for a team of four to manage the entire application.  The app is still available in the play store (India).</p>
