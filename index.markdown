# About
Hi, I am Robert and I am doing my bachelor's in Information Technology. I am interested in **Autonomous MAVs**, Swarm Intelligence, **IoT**, Peer-to-Peer Networks, Deep Learning, Distributed Learning, and Web Application Development tools. Currently, I am working on **Herd AI**, A swarm of autonomous MAVs that can do things together and can be tracked over the internet. I am very much interested in solving problems in my research areas.

# Ongoing Projects

### Internet of Flying THings -- Final Year Thesis
<img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/qn.jpeg">
Project Blue is all about developing a FANET for MAVs through which MAVs can share their local resources efficiently which in turn will increase the flight
time of entire MAVs connected to that FANET. The flight time of MAVs decreases rapidly as the number of sensors in MAVs increases. When dealing with a swarm of such MAVs, Flight time matters, and the data from the sensors of all MAVs might not be necessary most of the time. If an MAV can share its local resource with other MAVs like sensor data, location, Etc through a FANET in an efficient way, it can increase the flight time significantly. <br><br><br>


### Herd Ai
<img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/herd.jpg">
The project aims at building autonomous swarms of Micro UAVs for defense purposes.  Theseswarms can be tracked over the internet and can be controlled minimally over the internet.  Thisproject is an ongoing funded project.  More about this project can be [found here.](https://johnmaxrin.github.io/herdAI/)

# Previous Projects 

### Mimotico

<img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/mimotico.jpeg">
 An online platform where users can generate digital identities that can be used to prove or verify their identity anywhere. This project was a result of the research done on the vulnerabilities of the UIDAI Adhaar card. This project was funded by the state government and ASCII. [Github Link](https://github.com/johnmaxrin/mimotico)

### Work App

<img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/work.jpg">
Work is an online platform to find gig work and to find a worker. You can partner with us at the same time can find people to get things done. For Example, you are having an important meeting and won‚Äôt be able to clean your house. Simply hire someone from your locality listed on our platform to clean the house. You can also list yourself as a worker with the same app. It‚Äôs flexible, be your boss. You can choose when to work and when not to.

### Intervan

<img style="float: left; margin-right:10px; height:50px; width:50px;" src="images/intervan.jpg">
The  main  aim  behind  this  project  was  to  learn  how  a  programming  language  works  and,During my free time, I used to build Intervan.  It gave me a great insight into the working ofa compiled programming language. [Github Link](https://github.com/johnmaxrin/Intervan)

# Experience 

### Research
[Impact Lab](https://www.leopardtechlabs.com/) -- **Present**  <br>
Worked in the Geo-tagging section and used various frameworks and plugins to enable the location content delivery feature.  After that,  I was assigned with the work of using AWSBucket to store user-generated Images and to tag them automatically.  This internship was very helpful in getting to know more about industrial standards. <br> <br>

### Full Stack Developer
[Leopard Tech Labs](https://www.leopardtechlabs.com/) -- **6 Months**  <br>
Worked in the Geo-tagging section and used various frameworks and plugins to enable the location content delivery feature.  After that,  I was assigned with the work of using AWSBucket to store user-generated Images and to tag them automatically.  This internship was very helpful in getting to know more about industrial standards. <br> <br>
[Applore Tech](https://applore.in/) -- **1 Month** <br>
Worked with an e-commerce client to build their online store application using flutter and firebase.  Worked closely with the UX/UI team which gave a great insights into the importance of UX/UI.


### Flutter Developer
[Seventy3 Inc](http://seventy3.tech/) -- **12 Months** <br>
Built  an  application  that  helped  people  to  find  local  skilled/unskilled  workers,  Within  a radius  of  5  Kms.   This  application  was  slowly  gaining  traction  and  eventually  became  a hectic task for a team of four to manage the entire application.  The app is still available in the play store (India).
